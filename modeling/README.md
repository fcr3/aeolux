# Training and Testing

## Credits

We would like to acknowledge theses groups that contributed to the data and/or training and testing processes that we used for our project. Thank you so much!

1. `sunghyunjun`: Provided us the 1024x1024 jpg dataset that we used to train Tensorflow Object Detection models. The link can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/sunghyunjun/vinbigdata-1024-jpg-dataset).

2. `xhlulu`: Provided us the 256x256 and 512x512 png dataset that we used to train Detectron2 and Yolov5 models. The link to the 256x256 dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/vinbigdata-chest-xray-resized-png-256x256), and the link to the 512x512 dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/vinbigdata).

3. `VinBigData`: Provided us the original dataset as well as hosted a competition on Kaggle for users to experiment with the data they provided. The link to the competition is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/data)

4. `corochann`: Provided us an example notebook found in the VinBigData Kaggle competition code section. This notebook really demystified how to use Detectron2. Link to the notebook is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/corochann/vinbigdata-detectron2-train)

5. `naviocean`: Provided us an example on how to use Detectron2 to train Mobilenet and other models using Detectron2. Link to the repository is [here](https://github.com/naviocean/faster_rcnn_sku110).

6. `sxhxliang`: Provided us another example on how to use Detectron2, especially when it comes to specifying YAMLs. Link to the repostiory is [here](https://github.com/sxhxliang/detectron2_backbone).

7. `facebookresearch`: Provided us an example repository on how train a DETR (End-to-End Transformer Model for Object Detection) using Detectron2 (look in the d2 folder). Link to the repository is [here](https://github.com/sxhxliang/detectron2_backbone).

8. `ultralytics`: Provided us the official repository for training YoloV5 models. The official repository is [here](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).
